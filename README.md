> no abnormal condition at $\langle M\rangle$ for its y-axis is $10^{-15}$ unit

## 3.11
- check CP2024_code/Pytest_For_IsingSystem folder
- unit test is executed and its results are in Pytest.ipynb
- Unit test code is in Pytest.py
- Pytest.py, IsingSystemClass.py is needed

## 3.7
- check CP2024_code/IsingSystem/1-ResultCheck-week3.ipynb
- IsingSystemClass.py is needed

## 3.1
- Homework is in Homework/Week2 Folder!
